db2qthelp &mdash; a DocBook book to QtHelp project converter

Introduction
============

__db2qthelp__ converts a [DocBook](https://docbook.org/) [book](https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/4.5/book.html) to a [QtHelp](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qthelp-framework.html) project.

__db2qthelp__ is in an early stage of &ldquo;development&rdquo;. It works well for me but it may work with my setup only.

Any feedback is appreciated.


Background
==========

I usually write my user documentation using [DocBook](https://docbook.org/). For my recent applications built on top of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), I needed something
that generates in-app help pages. __db2qthelp__ does this.
